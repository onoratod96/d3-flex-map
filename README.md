D3 Code to produce flexible choropleth maps

## Viewing the maps

To view the map:
1. Open Command prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) (**Note:** You will need `python` installed on your machine). 
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Enter the following command:

```
python -m http.server 8888 &
```

This will create a local server on your machine over port 8888. Open your preferred browser, enter `http//:localhost:8888`, and click on the `.html` file you want to view.
